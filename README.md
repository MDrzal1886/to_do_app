# To_Do_App

## link to GitHub Pages: https://mdrzal1886.github.io/to_do_app/

This app is create to add tasks working with calendar.

## This app is build by create-react-app

I use only functions components with React Hooks like:

- useContext
- useState
- useEffect
- useRef

To add styles i use Sass.

I get calendar from https://github.com/fullcalendar/fullcalendar.
